# Mastermind Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic board game Mastermind, built with React. The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must guess within a certain number of attempts.

## Game Rules

The game randomly selects a sequence of 4 colors from a pool of 6 possible colors: yellow, orange, red, mediumorchid, royalblue, and limegreen. The player has 8 attempts to guess the sequence. Each guess is evaluated and the player is given feedback to help adjust their next guess.

## Built with
